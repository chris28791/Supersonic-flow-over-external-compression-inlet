# Supersonic-flow-over-external-compression-inlet

For the final project of MAE290C(CFD course) taken at UCSD, a supersonic flow over an external compression inlet was simulated using DNS. The main numerical method used was the McCormack method. Specific features of the code include grid transformation and block structuring. See full report for detail
